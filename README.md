Not the best bot for Discord in Python, but why not? I wrote it for a long time and there are no forces to correct old errors.

All settings in >> config.py

Main functions:
.play - random song from the list
.play_url - YouTube sound playback
.joke - random joke
.picture - random picture from the 'images' folder
.gif - random Gif - image from the 'gifs' folder
.save - accepts a link to download images and gifs as arguments
.spam - 2 message arguments and number of retries
.ping - current bot delay
.clear - clears a given number of images
